      "Video ID: 1GRTS2sFqhY\n",
      "video_description: The language of the Fulani people of West Africa, known as Pulaar, is spoken by over 40 million people, but for most of history, the language had no alphabet. Determined to preserve their native language since they were children, the Barry brothers created ADLaM, a handwritten alphabet for their people.\n",
      " \n",
      "Yet the need remained to digitize the alphabet so it could be used to communicate in the modern digital world, empowering the Fulani people to conduct business, connect through social media and find information in their own language.\n",
      " \n",
      "Though the brothers had developed early versions of the digital typeface, for the Fulani community to fully adopt and embrace it, the alphabet needed to be optimized and made more widely available in digital spaces. In partnership with the brothers and a group of expert typeface designers we created a revised version of the alphabet that was easier to read and write. Importantly, the new typeface was updated to include new letter forms that take into account how the alphabet has naturally evolved within the Fulani community.\n",
      " \n",
      "Microsoft has now integrated the redesigned alphabet across their global platforms. The revised version of the alphabet is now available to download on unlocked.microsoft.com as the ADLaM Display font and will be deployed natively across the Microsoft 365 suite of programs, desktop and mobile.\n",

      "Video ID: hdw1dThZzT0\n",
      "video_description: Delhi’s heatwaves are brutal. With climate change, they’re only getting worse. The people who suffer from the heat the most are often the least likely to receive support. They’re invisible to some, but not to SEEDS. With the help of Microsoft AI, SEEDS combines satellite imagery and hyperlocal weather data to identify who’s likely to be affected by a disaster, so they can pinpoint relief efforts on the people who need it most. Community mobilizers like Rinki Gupta ensure that no one is left behind. \n",

      "video_description: Pulaar, a dialect of the Fulani people of West Africa, is spoken by millions, but until recently had no alphabet. That meant the Fulani people’s poems, songs, menus, letters and emails were all written in other alphabets—slowly chipping away at the culture, ideas and history that shaped Pulaar. In 1989, two Fulani brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye set out to help preserve the Fulani culture by inventing an alphabet: ADLaM, which stands for ”Alkule Dandayɗe Leñol Mulugol” or “the alphabet that protects a people from vanishing.”\n",

      "Video ID: SsDabCTFOlc\n",
      "video_description: Can the story of Hip Hop be told through technology? \n",
      "\n",
      "A little over 50 years ago, an apartment party was held in the Bronx. Sedgwick Avenue, specifically. It was from here that Hip Hop would be introduced to the world from their small corner of the universe. \n",
      "\n",
      "A lot has changed in 50 years, but what’s remained consistent, from birth, is that Hip Hop has been the art of inspiration. Taking things that already exist—melodies, rhythms, lyrics, dance, fashion, ideas—and reforming them into something new, personal, unique. Then it’s paid forward, as each generation samples and remixes the work that came before. From the first mixers to the myriad tools you can find in the studios that exist today, technology has always lent a hand in helping Hip Hop artists tell their stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft teamed up with The Hip Hop Museum to empower the Hip Hop community to continue to create art in fresh, cutting-edge ways. The Hip Hop Museum is under construction and will open its doors as the Official Record of Hip Hop the summer of 2025.\n",
